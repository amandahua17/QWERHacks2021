Part 0 - You

The player's name is a text that varies.
When play begins: 
	now the command prompt is "What is your name? > ". 

To decide whether collecting names: 
	if the command prompt is "What is your name? > ", yes; 
	no. 

After reading a command when collecting names: 
	if the number of words in the player's command is greater than 1: 
		say "[paragraph break]It's okay, we're on a first name basis. What's just your first name?"; 
		reject the player's command; 
	now the player's name is the player's command; 
	now the command prompt is ">"; 
	say "Hi, [player's name]![paragraph break]"; 
	say "[banner text]"; 
	move the player to the location; 
	reject the player's command. 

Instead of looking when collecting names: do nothing. 

Rule for printing the banner text when collecting names: do nothing. 

Rule for constructing the status line when collecting names: do nothing. 



Part 1 - The Cafe

The Seeds Cafe is a room. "A barista stands humming behind the counter. Above the worker are three wooden panels showing the menu. There is an all gender bathroom next to the counter. To go to the bathroom, say 'go inside'. If you're ever at a loss as to what to do, try typing 'help'."

Sage is a person in the Seeds Cafe.

The player carries a backpack. The backpack is openable and closed. The backpack contains a laptop.
A person can be confident, nervous, excited, or embarrassed. A person can be active or passive. The player is confident.

	say "You sit down."

A booth is here. "There is a booth in the back of the room, its seats facing the table near the window. It is currently occupied by a teenager and a small child."

[Instead of talking when a restricted scene is happening:
	say "'Hi, my name is [player's name]. I was wondering if I could join you?'"]

Conversation is a restricted scene. Conversation begins when the player is embarrassed. When Conversation begins, say "The people in the booth behind you stand up to leave. You wish they had done that before you sat down, but now it would look weird if you rushed over to the booth, so you decide to stay where you are. The cute barista you were staring at takes off their apron and walks over to the booth with a drink. Looks like they're on break. Something compels you go talk to them. Maybe the color of their eyes? You stand up and walk over to the booth. 'Mind if I sit with you?' They look up and smile. Your heart flips in anticipation. 'Sure! I'm not going anywhere.'"

Instead of doing anything except talking or telling when a Conversation is happening: 
	say "You feel like maybe you should talk to Sage. You did sit down with them, after all. I could talk about: being [bold type]gay[roman type], the [bold type]weather[roman type], [bold type]Seattle[roman type], the [bold type]cafe[roman type]... (just say 'talk to Sage about [bold type]topic[roman type]')".

Instead of asking for help when a Conversation is happening,
	say "You worked up the courage to talk to Sage - try [bold type] talk[roman type]ing to them about something!" 

Table of Conversation 
topic	reply	quip
"day/cafe" or "what's up"	"'So how's your day going? Did you just get off shift?' 'Yep! I have about half an hour to kill before another engagement. The day's been up and down, customer-wise, so I'm getting off my feet for a bit.' The word 'engagement' makes your heart jump a little. "	"'You new around here? I don’t think I've seen you before.' You shrug. 'Just got to Seattle yesterday, been looking around since then.'"
"gay/queer/pronouns"	"'So,' you say. 'This might be a bit forward, but what are your pronouns? And are you gay?' The last part slips out before you can stop yourself. You flush. 'I, er,' they say. 'I use she/they pronouns, thanks for asking!' They smile at you. 'And yes, I listen to Girl in Red. What gave it away? Was it the giant dangly earrings?' You laugh. 'No, just the bangs and blue hair.'"	"After a moment of silence, Sage says, 'I like your septum piercing!' You feel your face grow hot. 'Thanks,' you say, but nothing else comes to mind."
"location/Seattle/Washington"	"'Are you from Seattle originally?’ you ask.

‘Nope, I used to live in St. Louis, but I moved to Seattle for school and have been here since I graduated, last spring.' Note to self: they're around your age."	"'What brings you to Seeds?' Her eyes are really pretty. You give a start. Stop staring! 'I am actually here to check out UW. I got into the CS Masters program, but I also have a job offer in New York, so I thought it would be a good idea to check out the locations for myself.'" 
"weather/rain/cold"	"'Is the weather always like this here?' you ask. 'It seems like the only downside.'

Sage laughs. 'It's not too bad, just takes some getting used to.'"	"'If you're not used to it, the Seattle weather can be a bit dreary,' Sage remarks."


Instead of telling Sage about something: try asking the noun about it.

Conversation ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Conversation is 0. When Conversation ends, say "'Oh shoot, I gotta go, I have an interview and I lost track of time!' She looks at you and grins. Your heart skips again. 'Well, it was lovely to meet you! I'm sure we'll meet again.' Before you can say anything else, they run out the door."

Every turn during Conversation: 
	if Sage is active: 
		repeat through Table of Conversation: 
			say "[quip entry][paragraph break]"; 
			blank out the whole row; 
			make no decision. 

Every turn during Conversation: now Sage is active.

A shoe rack is in your closet.

Instead of asking for help when Apartment is happening, 
	say "You're in your apartment - try to [bold type]start conversation with[roman type] your roommate, [bold type]Nik. [roman type]" 

Instead of going your closet: try going inside. 
Instead of going inside when Apartment is happening: say "What would I want to go back in there for? Just kidding, but I've got all the clothes I need at the moment."
Nik is a person in the bedroom. 
[TODO: figure out how to put player's name as an option, and also why everything is passive]

Table of Roommate
topic	reply	quip
"cute person" or "person"	"‘So, I met this person today at the cafe… they’re really sweet, and totally my type. And get this - they’re possibly going to UW for grad school!’ Nik looks up, startled. ‘Really? I bet your mind is going out of control planning your wedding already!’ You snort. ‘Just because we might be going to the same school and I think they’re cute doesn’t mean we’re soulmates. Still… the UW CS program is really good. Doesn’t hurt to have someone with shared interests.’"	"‘Oh come on.’ Nik is staring at you. ‘I know you only have that look when something interesting has happened. Spill!’

You sigh. ‘I met this really cute person at the cafe today… and-they-might-be-going-to-grad-school-at-UW!’ The last part all comes out at once. Nik raises his eyebrows. ‘Not too shabby. Sounds like a perfect person for a date?’ They smirk at their last comment."
"their day" or "what's new" or "what's up" or "day"	"‘What’s up with you? Any new adventures?’ Nik sighs. ‘Not really, Alice wants to go to this backyard concert tomorrow but Cal wants to stay in and watch a movie. Not quite sure what to pick, but maybe they’ll work it out among themselves and I won’t have to decide.’ I shake my head. ‘Well, while you’re waiting for their decision you can come visit me at the cafe on my next shift, keep me some company and keep an eye out for the cute person I saw today!’"	"Nik sighs. ‘Alice wants to go to this backyard concert tomorrow but Cal wants to stay in and watch a movie. Not quite sure what to pick, but maybe they’ll work it out among themselves and I won’t have to decide.’ I shake my head. ‘Well, while you’re waiting for their decision you can come visit me at the cafe on my next shift, keep me some company and keep an eye out for the cute person I saw today!’ He narrows his eyes at you. ‘I’ll be your wingperson, but only if I happen to be free.’ They stick out their tongue and sigh again."
"advice/anticipation/excitement/nervous" or "first date"	"‘I really hope this person comes back to the cafe, they seem so easy to talk to!’ Nik looks at you, smirking again. ‘I hope it goes as well as the last first date you were on. Didn’t you steal their keys?’ You turn on him. ‘I did nothing of the sort! Also, he wanted to go on the date with me!’ ‘Yes, yes, I know. Pretended to know about Japanese food to impress you just because he wanted to go on a date with you. And your regular boba place barista put heart stickers on your drinks, very cheesy, but very cute, I will admit.’ You huff, a little annoyed. ‘Talk about cheesy, huh? What about the time you ran 20 miles to spell out a message asking that girl to go to Pride with you?’ Nik grins. ‘See, I know that’s cute, and that’s the difference.’"	"Nik looks at you, smirking again. ‘Well anyway, I hope this new person you’re brooding over asks you on a date and it goes as well as the last first date you were on. Didn’t you steal their keys?’ You turn on him. ‘I did nothing of the sort! Also, he wanted to go on the date with me!’ ‘Yes, yes, I know.

"
"interview"	"‘So the interview today went well. I still think I might want to go to grad school though… That person today and UW’s CS program. A lot to think about.’ Nik looks at you out of the corner of their eye. ‘Just make sure you don’t make a decision based on a person you haven’t even gone on a date with yet.’ ‘I know! I know...’"	"‘So how was the interview?’, Nik asks, throwing the fidget cube up in the air. ‘Oh, it was good. I still think I might want to go to grad school though… That person today and UW’s CS program. A lot to think about.’ Nik looks at you out of the corner of their eye. ‘Just make sure you don’t make a decision based on a person you haven’t even gone on a date with yet.’ ‘I know! I know...’"

Conversation2 is a restricted scene. Conversation2 begins when the player is ready to talk. When Conversation2 begins, say "'Hi Nik. Whatcha doing on my bed?' They grin. 'Oh, you know, just seeing what your new crisis is about.' You scowl. You suppose you should probably try to talk to him about something. Maybe you should talk to them about the [bold type]person[roman type] you met at the cafe? Or about your [bold type]interview[roman type]? Or ask for their [bold type]advice[roman type]? A lot has happened today. You could also ask about [bold type]their day[roman type]. (say 'ask Nik about [bold type]topic[roman type]')".

Instead of doing anything except talking or telling when a Conversation2 is happening: 
	say "Maybe you should ask Nik about something? They are pretty talkative, though, so maybe they'll talk on their own. You could ask them about the cute person you met today, or their day, or your interview..."

When Wait begins, now the player is in At Home.

Wait ends when the player is excited.

	now player is in Park;
	now Sage is in Park;
	now Sage is passive.
	
Park is a room. A quaint path is here. "You walk a couple minutes and come to a small park. Sage leads you onto a quaint path, and you walk together. It's quiet. Maybe you should say something? Or maybe Sage will break the silence for you. You think about what gays talk about on a first date. Maybe you could ask about their [bold type]family[roman type], [bold type]future[roman type], [bold type]coming out[roman type] experience, or [bold type]astrology[roman type]?"

Instead of asking for help when Date is happening,
	say "You're finally on a date with Sage! Try [bold type]talk[roman type]ing to them about something." 

Table of Date
topic	reply	quip
"family/childhood"	"‘You said you grew up in St. Louis? Do you have any siblings?’ ‘Yeah, I’m actually a triplet. My parents got two gays out of it - and we bully our token straight at every chance’"	"‘Not feeling talkative? That’s okay. We can just walk around the park quietly for a bit’"
"goals/job/career/school/future"	"‘What does the future hold for you? Any grand visions?’ You ask. ‘I’m hoping to move into tech, which is why I recognized that rainbow Github sticker on your laptop.’ You laugh, it was a gift from a high school friend. ‘So I’m saving up for grad school and taking some online classes.’"	"‘Here, I’ll tell a story. My prom night was a wild ride. I really wanted a gay prom, but I was closeted at the time and my parents were so excited to see me go with a nice boy. So I took prom photos with a friend of mine, and then as soon as my mom left, we all shuffled around and I got to spend my prom night with my girlfriend at the time. It was great.’ We drift into silence for a minute, admiring nature as we walk. Eventually, you break the silence."
"come out" or "coming out" or "support"	"‘Was your family supportive when you came out?’

‘Y’know, I was the first gay person that my parents knew. I grew up pretty religious, and they weren’t exactly prepared for all this.’ They gestured vaguely. ‘But they just needed some time. We’re on pretty good terms these days.’"	"‘We got so lucky with the weather today - it’s so rarely this sunny. Any other day, you’d be the hottest thing in sight.’ The compliment was unexpected, but welcome."
"zodiac/astrology"	"‘I have to ask the gay cliche - what’s your zodiac sign?’

‘It’s embarrassing, but I actually don’t know anything other than my sun. I’m an Aquarius.’

‘Oh that’s funny! I only ask because I dated someone in college who knew astrology inside and out’

‘It’s a great queer unifier,’ Sage laughs."	"As you walk, their hand brushes up against yours. Once you get your breathing back under control, you reach out and took her hand."

Grad school sounds really good. And I can't turn down everything else about Seattle.' They reply, smiling, 'Well then, I've got a lot to show you.'[paragraph break] The end. "
